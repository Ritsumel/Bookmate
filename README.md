# 📖 Bookmate

Bookmate is a fullstack web application for managing books and quotes, built with an Angular frontend and a C# (ASP.NET Core) backend.

The application allows users to register, log in, and manage books and quotes through a secure REST API.  
A strong focus of this project has been authentication and authorization, demonstrating secure user handling and protected API routes.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

Bookmate implements JWT-based authentication using ASP.NET Core.

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers via `/api/auth/register`
2. User logs in via `/api/auth/login`
3. On successful login, a JWT token is generated
4. The token includes user claims and expiration time
5. Protected endpoints require a valid JWT in the Authorization header

### Security Features

- Input validation and trimming
- Case-insensitive username handling
- Minimum username and password length validation
- Duplicate username prevention
- Token-based authentication using HMAC SHA256 signing
- Configurable JWT key, issuer, and audience via `appsettings.json`
- Token expiration (1 hour)

This demonstrates secure client–server authentication and protected API route handling.

Note: Passwords are stored in-memory for demonstration purposes only.
